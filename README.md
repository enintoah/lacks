# [Lacks](https://appacademylacks.herokuapp.com/#/)

Lacks is a fully interactive clone of the popular work messaging app, Slack. Lacks was created as a demonstration of my abilities in web development and software engineering. You can create an account and join workspaces. In these workspaces, there are channels and direct messages where live messaging is enabled.
